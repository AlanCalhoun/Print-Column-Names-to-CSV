# Print-Column-Names-to-CSV

Made for me by TM.

This gets all the csv’s in a folder then creates another csv with the file name, column name, and data type. I used this for data discovery, and to ease copy and pasting.

This may take some time to process depending on the number and size of the csv’s.
